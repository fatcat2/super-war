# super-war
## Objective: Create a program that simulates the card game war
<p>Author: @fatcat2</p>
<p>What started as a programming tune-up project has evolved into more of a stats project</p>
<p>Basically what I have done is created a program that simulates the card game War with two players. The user gets to decide
	how many cards each player starts with, and depending on the program, let's it run its course. At the end of two of the files,
	I generate a line using matplotlib:</p>
	*Number of Cards in Each Deck vs Turns
	*Average Number of Cards in Each Deck Over X Amount of Turns vs Amount of Turns Over x Iterations

## Methodology
